    <h1>Vue3 Notes</h1>
    <p>
      I found myself going back to the docs looking for the same things over and
      over. And running into the same questions over and over that I didn't
      totally understand. So I've cobbled-together this collection of examples,
      notes, and resources for myself. ðŸ‘¾
