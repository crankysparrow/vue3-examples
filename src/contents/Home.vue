		<h1>Vue3 Notes</h1>
		<p>
			I found myself going back to the docs looking for the same things
			over and over. And running into the same questions over and over
			that I didn't totally understand. So I've cobbled-together this
			collection of examples, notes, and resources for myself.

		<p>
			Most of the examples feature characters from
			<em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> 👾
